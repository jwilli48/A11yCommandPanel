# A11yCommandPanel
This is a WPF application to provide a GUI for all of the accessibility scripts that I have made. This allows anyone who has it to be able to run any of the scripts I have made by just clicking a button / filling out a small form. 

Needs to have the CSharpReportGenerator project as well in order to fully work.
