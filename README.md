# A11yCommandPanel
This is a WPF application to provide a GUI for all of the accessibility scripts that I have made. This allows anyone who has it to be able to run any of the scripts I have made by just clicking a button / filling out a small form. 

Needs to have the CSharpReportGenerator project as well in order to fully work.

To access Canvas / .instructure courses you need to create a CanvasApiCreds.json file at C:\Users\UserName\Documents\
Should have: 
    Token: GeneratedCanvasToken
    BaseUrl: domain.instructure.com
